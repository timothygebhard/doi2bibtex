**doi2bibtex** is a small Python package that can be used to resolve DOIs (and other identifiers) into a BibTeX entry and format them according to a customizable set of rules (see below for a full list of features).

Most features of **doi2bibtex** are availabe in other tools. 
For example, you can chain together [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org) with [bibtool](https://github.com/ge-ne/bibtool) or [bibtex-tidy](https://github.com/FlamingTempura/bibtex-tidy) and recover most of the functionality in this package (and some of these tools are actually used under the hood). 
If you use a reference manager like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), you can also resolve papers based on an identifier and later export entries to a `.bib` file.

The motivation for **doi2bibtex** was rather personal and came from two facts: 1. I have a rather strong opinion on how I want my `.bib` files to look like, and 2. I work on the intersection of astrophysics and machine learning, meaning that I often need the [NASA/ADS](https://adsabs.harvard.edu) bibcodes for the `adsurl` field, but I can’t solely rely on ADS to retrieve BibTeX entries because I also frequently cite papers that are not indexed by ADS. 
At some point, I got tired of the ever-growing mess of shell scripts and bash commands that I used to achieve this, and decided to re-write as a single package that would be easier to maintain and extend.



## 🚀 Quickstart

Follow these instructions to get started with `doi2bibtex`:



### 🤓 Installation

You can simply `pip`-install the package using:

```bash
pip install doi2bibtex
```

Alternatively, you can also clone the repository and install the package locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timothygebhard/doi2bibtex.git
cd doi2bibtex
pip install .
```



### 🔑 Setting up an API key for ADS

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to use ADS, you can disable this feature (which is enabled by default) by setting `resolve_adsurl: false` in your `~/.doi2bibtex/config.yaml` file.

If you want to use the `ads` backend to resolve the `adsurl` field, you need to create an ADS account (if you do not alreay have one) and set up an [API token](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/) to be able to query ADS. You can actually do this in two different ways:

1. Set the environment variable `ADS_TOKEN` to your API key:
   ```bash
   export ADS_TOKEN="your-token";
   ```
   Ideally, you should add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

2. Create a file `~/.doi2bibtex/ads_token` and put your API key in there.


### 💻 Using the command line interface

Once installed, using the package is as simple as running the `d2b` command in your terminal:

```bash
d2b <doi-or-arxiv_id>
```

You can also add the `--plain` flag to output only the BibTeX entry without any fancy formatting. This can be useful if you, for example, want to pipe the output of the `d2b` command to another program.




### ⚙️ Changing the default configuration

A lot of the features of **doi2bibtex** can be configured via a `~/.doi2bibtex/config.yaml` file. Here is an overview of all the supported options (with the default values):

```yaml
abbreviate_journal_names: true  # Convert journal names to LaTeX macros (e.g., "\apj" instead of "The Astrophysical Journal")
citekey_delimiter: '_'          # Delimiter between the author name and the year of publication
convert_latex_chars: true       # Convert LaTeX-encoded characters in author names to Unicode
convert_month_to_number: true   # Convert month names to numbers (e.g., "1" instead of "jan")
crossmatch_with_dblp: false     # [EXPERIMENTAL] Try to crossmatch the paper with DBLP to add venue information to `addendum` (for ML conferences papers)
fix_arxiv_entrytype: true       # Convert arXiv entries to `@article`, set `journal` to "arXiv preprints", and drop the `eprinttype` field
format_author_names: true       # Convert author names to the "{Lastname}, Firstname" format
generate_citekey: true          # Create a citekey based on the first author and year of publication
limit_authors: 1000             # Limit the number of authors in the BibTeX entry
pygments_theme: 'dracula'       # Pygments theme used for syntax highlighting in the terminal
remove_fields:                  # Remove undesired fields (e.g., keywords) from the BibTeX entry
  all: ['abstract']             # Remove the `abstract` from all entries, regardless of entrytype
  article: ['publisher']        # Remove the `publisher` field from @article entries
remove_url_if_doi: true         # Remove the `url` field if it is redundant with the `doi` field
resolve_adsurl: true            # Query ADS to resolve the `adsurl` field, requires API token
update_arxiv_if_doi: true       # Update arXiv entries with DOI information, if available ("related DOI")
```



## 🦄 Features

Besides the eponymous ability of resolving DOIs (and other identifiers) to BibTeX entries, this package offers a lot more features for post-processing the entries. Here are some highlights:

- Automatically resolve the `adsurl` field required by some astrophysics journals (requires an [API token](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/) for ADS)
- Cross-match entries (in particular: arXiv preprints) with [dblp.org](https://dblp.org/) to retrieve the venue information for conference papers from machine learning (e.g., "ICLR 2021"). Note: This feature is still experimental because querying dblp is somewhat fickle.
- Convert LaTeX-encoded characters in author names to Unicode, for example, `Müller` instead of `M{\"u}ller`
- Author names can automatically be converted to the `{Lastname}, Firstname` format
- You can limit the number of authors in the BibTeX entry
- Create a `citekey` based on the first author and year of publication. The author name is automatically made ASCII-compatible: for example, `Đà Nẵng et al. (2023)` becomes `DaNang_2023`.
- Journal names can automatically be abbreviated according to the common LaTeX macros (e.g., `\apj` instead of `The Astrophysical Journal`)
- Undesired fields (e.g, `keywords`) can be removed from the BibTeX entry (customizable for each `entrytype` — e.g., remove the `publisher` for articles, but keep it for books)
- Easy to extend / modify: Feel free to fork this repository and adjust things to your own needs!
